# FEATURES.md

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-12
**Purpose**: Feature development pipeline - polish, testing, and enhancements for the simulation

This document tracks feature work, bug fixes, and test coverage improvements for the **current working simulation** (multi-map hobbit escape). Tasks are sized for Zone 1 sessions and ordered by urgency + value.

**📍 For immediate next session work, see [NEXT_SESSION.md](NEXT_SESSION.md)**

## ⏭️ Skipped Tests (Deferred Features)

**Test Suite Status:** 52 passed, 2 skipped

These tests represent **intentionally deferred features**, not bugs. They are skipped because the current implementation works and the features are YAGNI until proven otherwise.

### SKIP #1: Exit Buffer System
**Test:** `test_escaped_hobbits_tracked_separately_from_active` (test_hobbit_sim.py:232)
**What:** Separate tracking for exited hobbits vs active ones
**Current Behavior:** Hobbits "stack" at exit position to represent escaped state
**When to implement:** When multi-map journey tracking needs to distinguish "truly escaped" from "still fleeing"
**Estimated:** 4-6 hours (architectural change)

### SKIP #2: Pathfinding Around Nazgûl
**Test:** `test_hobbit_routes_around_nazgul_to_avoid_capture` (test_hobbit_sim.py:333)
**What:** Hobbits detect Nazgûl in their path and route around them
**Current Behavior:** Hobbits move directly toward goal, may walk into Nazgûl
**When to implement:** When playtesting reveals frustrating/unfair captures
**Estimated:** 2-3 hours (pathfinding enhancement)

**Decision:** Keep tests skipped. Unskip only when features become necessary.

## 🐛 Now (Bugs/Missing Pieces - 15-30 min each)

*(All "Now" items completed! Check "Soon" section for test coverage improvements)*

---

## 🧪 Soon (Test Coverage - 30 min)

**Current coverage:** 89% (41 lines uncovered)

**Focus:** Validate success path (multi-map victory), defer edge cases for now

**📍 For detailed test coverage work, see [NEXT_SESSION.md](NEXT_SESSION.md) Path A (Foundation)**

### System Test: Multi-Map Victory Journey (Enhance Existing)
**Current**: `test_acceptance_full_simulation_succeeds()` validates victory outcome but doesn't verify the 3-map journey
**Gap**: Test doesn't confirm hobbits actually traverse all 3 maps (Map 0 → Map 1 → Map 2)
**Action**: Enhance existing test to check event log for map transitions
**Test enhancements**:
- Verify event log contains 2 "map_transition" events
- Confirm transitions are Map 0→1 and Map 1→2
- Validate hobbits complete full journey, not just reach "victory"
**Why**: Core feature needs end-to-end validation
**Estimated**: 30 minutes

**Deferred (focus on success path for now):**
- Defeat test - Revisit when adding difficulty scaling
- Timeout test - Tests infrastructure, not user-facing value

### Coverage: Interactive Display Code
**Current**: Lines 1080-1097 (`run_simulation()` and `display_tick`) untested
**Decision needed**: Should we test interactive display?
**Options**:
1. **Exclude from coverage** - add `# pragma: no cover` (it's UI code)
2. **Smoke test only** - manual verification sufficient
3. **Mock test** - capture print output, verify format
**Recommendation**: Option 1 (exclude) - interactive display is outside core logic
**Estimated**: 10 minutes (add pragma comments)

## 🤔 Maybe (Needs Design Discussion - 1-3 hours)

These might add value but need validation. Playtest and feel the pain before implementing.

### Exit Buffer System (Skipped Test)
**Current**: Hobbits "stack" at exit position, then respawn together on next map
**Skipped test**: `test_escaped_hobbits_tracked_separately_from_active` (line 236)
**Related test case**: "Test a race where a hobbit makes it to safety while another is en route - the nazgul should not be able to capture the one that made it to safety" (removed from code TODO on 2025-11-13, tracked here instead)
**Question**: Should we track "permanently escaped" vs "still active in journey"?
**Use case**: Display "2/3 hobbits safe" when one gets captured on Map 1
**Current behavior**: If hobbit captured on Map 1, they're just... gone. No "2 escaped earlier" tracking.
**Design considerations**:
- Add `escaped_hobbits: set[HobbitId]` to WorldState?
- Update transition: move exiting hobbits to escaped set, spawn only active ones on next map?
- Victory condition: `len(escaped_hobbits) + len(hobbits) == starting_count`?
- Display: "3 hobbits active, 0 safe" → "2 active, 1 safe" → "0 active, 3 safe"
**Concern**: Adds complexity for unclear benefit - is current "all or nothing" fine?
**Decision needed**: Do we care about partial party escape tracking?
**Estimated**: 2-3 hours (design + implementation + tests)

### Variable Map Sizes
**Current**: All maps 20x20 (hardcoded in `WORLD_WIDTH`/`WORLD_HEIGHT`)
**Question**: Should maps grow/shrink for variety and pacing?
**Proposed progression**:
- Map 0 (Bag End): 15x15 - tight, claustrophobic, 1 Nazgûl
- Map 1 (Shire Forest): 20x20 - standard, 2 Nazgûl
- Map 2 (Crickhollow): 25x25 - sprawling, harder to navigate, 3 Nazgûl
**Changes needed**:
- Add `width`/`height` to `MapConfig`
- Update `create_map()` to use config dimensions
- Update terrain generation to respect variable size
- Update all position calculations to use `state.width`/`state.height`
**Concern**: More complexity in terrain generation, unclear gameplay benefit
**Decision needed**: Playtest current maps first - do they feel samey/repetitive?
**Estimated**: 1-2 hours (update MapConfig, refactor terrain, test all maps)

### Hobbit Pathfinding (Skipped Test)
**Current**: Hobbits move directly toward goal, may walk into Nazgûl
**Skipped test**: `test_hobbit_routes_around_nazgul_to_avoid_capture` (line 337)
**Question**: Should hobbits detect and avoid Nazgûl in their path?
**Current behavior**: "Dumb but fast" - hobbits flee when Nazgûl close, but don't anticipate collisions
**Proposed behavior**: Check 1-2 moves ahead, route around known Nazgûl positions
**Concern**:
- May be too "smart" - reduces challenge/drama
- Adds pathfinding complexity (A*, Dijkstra, or simple lookahead?)
- Could make game too easy if hobbits perfectly avoid threats
**Decision needed**: Is current movement causing frustrating/unfair captures?
**Recommendation**: Playtest first - if hobbits regularly walk into avoidable captures, revisit
**Estimated**: 3-4 hours (pathfinding algorithm + collision prediction + tests)

## Notes

**Philosophy**: "Test what you fear breaking" - pragmatic TDD
**Zone 1 friendly**: Features sized for sustainable, low-capacity sessions
**Coverage goal**: 92-95% on core simulation logic (interactive display excluded)
**Playtest often**: Run `uv run python hobbit_sim.py` to feel the changes
**YAGNI principle**: Don't add exit buffers/pathfinding/variable sizes until needed
**Test strategy**: System tests for user scenarios, unit tests for components

**Why "Now/Soon/Maybe/Later"?**
- **Now**: Bugs or missing polish, immediate user impact
- **Soon**: Test coverage gaps, technical debt
- **Maybe**: Might be over-engineering, validate need via playtesting first
- **Later**: Big features, wait until current foundation is solid

**Coverage interpretation**:
- **88% overall**: Good baseline
- **Uncovered lines 1080-1097**: Interactive display (UI code, can exclude)
- **Uncovered lines 931-949**: Internal rendering helper (covered via integration tests)
- **Uncovered lines 972-975, 1019-1030**: Edge cases (timeout, defeat) - add system tests

**Next recommended session** (60-90 min):
1. Fix entry point rendering (15 min)
2. Add victory/defeat message (15 min)
3. Write multi-map system test (45 min)
→ Playtest manually, enjoy the polished experience!
