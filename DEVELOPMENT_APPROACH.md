# Development Approach - Zone 1 Exercise

## Purpose

This project is part of mind fitness work during long COVID recovery. The goal is to find flow state in coding through playful, sustainable practice that builds endurance without causing crashes.

## Core Principles

1. **Easy mode first** - Avoid scope creep and over-engineering
2. **Single file initially** - Maximize simplicity
3. **Print statements before visualizations** - Text output first
4. **Hardcoded before configurable** - Get it working, then make it flexible
5. **No performance optimization until actually slow** - Pure Python is fine

## Development Philosophy

### Zone 1 Pacing
Build incrementally. Each version adds ONE feature, test it, verify it feels good, then continue or pivot.

Break problems into tiny pieces:
1. Can we print a grid?
2. Can we place entities on the grid?
3. Can we make them move?
4. Do the rules work?

Each question is its own micro-milestone. Build confidence through tiny successes.

### Flow State Goals
- Playful, intrinsically interesting problems
- Clear forward progress without mystery debugging
- Well-trodden paths in training data (Python basics, grid simulations, simple agents)
- Avoiding performance traps and scope creep that lead to frustration

### Pairing Approach
The ping-pong pairing with Claude Code should:
- Break problems into tiny pieces
- Maintain conversational flow
- Create small wins without pressure
- Allow breaks as needed

## Success Metrics

- Code runs without errors
- Simulation produces interesting outcomes
- Process feels engaging (not frustrating)
- Forward momentum maintained across sessions

Remember: The goal isn't perfect code. The goal is rebuilding coding capacity through playful, sustainable practice.
