# Development Approach - Zone 1 Exercise

## Purpose

This project is mind fitness work exploring new stacks:
- **Tech stack:** Python, strict type checking (mypy), linting (ruff), test-driven development (pytest)
- **Development stack:** Claude Code subagents, automated code quality pipelines, AI-assisted workflows

The goal is to find flow state in coding through playful, sustainable practice that builds technical capacity gradually—learning both new languages/tools and new ways of working with AI assistance.

## Core Principles

1. **Easy mode first** - Avoid scope creep and over-engineering
2. **Single file initially** - Maximize simplicity
3. **Print statements before visualizations** - Text output first
4. **Hardcoded before configurable** - Get it working, then make it flexible
5. **No performance optimization until actually slow** - Pure Python is fine

## Development Philosophy

### Zone 1 Pacing
Build incrementally. Each version adds ONE feature, test it, verify it feels good, then continue or pivot.

Break problems into tiny pieces:
1. Can we print a grid?
2. Can we place entities on the grid?
3. Can we make them move?
4. Do the rules work?

Each question is its own micro-milestone. Build confidence through tiny successes.

### Flow State Goals
- Playful, intrinsically interesting problems
- Clear forward progress without mystery debugging
- Well-trodden paths in training data (Python basics, grid simulations, simple agents)
- Avoiding performance traps and scope creep that lead to frustration

### Pairing Approach
The ping-pong pairing with Claude Code should:
- Break problems into tiny pieces
- Maintain conversational flow
- Create small wins without pressure
- Allow breaks as needed

## Success Metrics

- Code runs without errors
- Simulation produces interesting outcomes
- Process feels engaging (not frustrating)
- Forward momentum maintained across sessions

Remember: The goal isn't perfect code. The goal is building capacity with new stacks (tech and development) through playful, sustainable practice.
